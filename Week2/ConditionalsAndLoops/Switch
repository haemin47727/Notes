switch statement
-decision-making statement for finite number of outcomes such as hours or floors.
switch(your_variable){
    case 1: //each case value is compared with switch value.
    //code to be executed such as System.out.println("");
    break;    //exits the switch and continue with rest of program with case identification.
    case 2:
    //code;
    break;
    default:
    //code executed if no case value is matched
    break;

-switch statement is designed to have "fall through" behavior
where without a break statement, once case is matched, each subsequent case is triggered too.
