while loop
-iterate (repeat) code as long as condition is true.
while(boolean condition){
-boolean is checked before each iteration of the loop.

do while loop
-code is always executed at least once as the condition is checked at the bottom not top.
do{
}while (boolean condition);

boolean condition shouldnt be always true as the code will run forever.
