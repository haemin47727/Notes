for loop
-iterate over range of values to repeat a sequence of code.
for (initialization; condition ; iteration){
statement;
}
-initialization sets starting value of iteration loop.
-boolean condition is tested in the beginning and each time the loop completes a cycle.
    will exit loop if false.
-iteration determines how the control variable in the initialization is change with each
iteration.
-each (of three) portion is optional so leaving all out will be infinite loop.

for each loop
for(type iteration-variable : collection){
String[] collection = {"This", "is" , "a" , "collection"};
for(String item: collection){
    System.out.println("The item is :" +item);

All loops can be nested within any other type of loop as many times as possible.

for(int[] outer: nums){
    for(int val:outer){
    System.out.print(val);
  }
  System.out.println();
}
