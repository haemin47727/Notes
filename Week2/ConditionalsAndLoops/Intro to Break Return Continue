return statement
-used to exit a method.
-if method is type void, write return; with nothing else
-if method is any type other than void, must return a variable of that type.

break statement
-break out of loop
-break with label :
one: {
    two: {
        if(i==0){
            break one; //breaks to label one
        }
     System.out.println("label two"); //if i is not one.
    }
System.out.println("label one");
}
-break without label : breaks out of loop and continue to execute directly outside of it.

continue statement
-stop iteration of loop prematurely but will continue to next iteration without leaving closest loop.
