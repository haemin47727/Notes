Passed by Reference
-object is passed to another method as a argument not as a copy unlike primitive data type

Object
-object data type such as String.
-dont have simple binary value
-sometimes contain own primitive variables and reserve and hold memory on the heap
-when it's passed to second method, the second method receives REFERENCE in memory to object
-any change in object in second method will affect object in calling method.
-store data, act on that data, interact with other objects
- class is object's data type when object is created from a class
- has own copy of each of instance variables in the class

Creating Object
ex) Person somePerson = new Person(); //somePerson is reference to object new Person()

Adding Instance Variables
ex)somePerson.age = 36;
   somePerson.height = 72.2;
   somePerson.name = "Jose";
