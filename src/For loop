default value of an int primitive is zero
For loop
-finite iteration
-for (initalize counter; boolean condition; incrementer/decrementer (iteration) )
for(int i =100; i>=0; i-=25){Sout("");} as long as middle boolean (i>=0) condition is true
it keeps looping.

While loop
-while (boolean) //while boolean condition is true, then loop will run
non-finite iteration
int count =0;
while(count < 10000){Sout(""+count); count++; }

do while loop (execute at least once)

break = break out of the loop and go to whatever executable code is next
continue = go back to main loop such as while loop

arrays are random access (data store) in [ ] index is from 0 from left. index -1
for each loop
for each int in...sout
