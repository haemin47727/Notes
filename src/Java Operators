Arithmetic Operators

    + - * / %(modulus)
    int mod = 10 % 3; // result is 1

    -Short-hand Arithmetic Operators
    += -= *= /= %=
    a += 10 means a = a + 10 (right side will execute first so now a becomes 11 when a=1);


Relational Operators
-result evaluates to boolean value (true/false)
-always used with if statements.

    < <= > >= == != (six)
    instead of using = , must use ==.
    System.out.println(a % b == 0 );
    if (val1 == val2) {...


Logical Operators (Conditional operators)
-result evaluates to boolean.

    & && | || ^(one can be true but not both) !

    *Short circuit AND / OR
    Second boolean evaluated only when necessary. Result comes out faster & less memory usage.
    only when left is true, will evaluate right side.
    if (a && b) {System.out.println("This will print")};

Ternary Operators (Conditional operators)
-uses three operands
-evaluated as 'if aCondition ? valueOne : valueTwo
//if a condition is true, then valueOne otherwise valueTwo
    class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args){
        int x = 10;
        int y = 20;
        String result = x > y ? "x is greater than y" : "x is less than y";
        // Output: "x is less than y"


Assignment Operators
-assigns values to variables
= single equals sign
