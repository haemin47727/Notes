Declare variable x: int x;
Initialize variable x: x=10;

Code block
    - blocks of code inside curly brackets such as class, method, loops, if, try/catch, switch

Local variables
    -Exist within curly brackets of method and cannot be seen by other class.
    //Variable scope is region of code within which a variable is accessible.
    {}define the scope.
    //method parameters= variables/arguments that exist only in the method declared
        public int multiply (int a, int b){ return a* b }; int a and int b = parameters

Instance variables
    -Variables declared outside of methods and exist as members of a class.
    -Visible to other members (variables and methods) within same class and other classes
    depending on access modifiers such as public, private and protected.
    //class Person { String name; int age; }
Static variables
    -Variables visible to other members but unlike instance variables, not each instance
    of class has its own copy of static variable.
    -shared by all instances of a class.
