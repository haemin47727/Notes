Polymorphism
- methods and classes that have many forms
1) Overloading methods
-having same method name but different method parameter or number (return type doesn't matter)
-System.out.println()

2) Overriding Body/Behavior or Parent Methods
@Override

3) Implementing Interfaces
- define own body/functionality for methods implemented from interface
- class that implements an interface becomes a type of the interface
- this interface type can be used as instance variable in other class

4) Implementing Abstract Classes
- called subtype polymorphism or inheritance polymorphism
- objects of subclass can be treated as objects of superclass
