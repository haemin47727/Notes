"\t" = two space to the right. // "P\t\tQ"; will result in P  Q (double space)

System.out.println("") // Print result and next result will be different line
System.out.print("")// Print result and next result will be same line

\n next word prints in new line: System.out.print("Each\nWord"); will print Word next line.

System.in.read() : only reads value of ONE byte (8 bits : 0000 0000) at a time.
When user presses enter it's also another value. System.in.read() does ascii table value
and it's only for English. So value of byte is not always ascii value since it could be different
in another language / UTF - 8

char alphabet = word.charAt(i);
"aeiou".indexOf(alphabet) != -1
// i = index here
